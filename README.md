Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. It utilizes the `creditcard.csv` dataset, which includes transaction details labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. The code starts by loading and exploring the dataset, analyzing the distribution of transaction types, and addressing class imbalance by sampling legitimate transactions to balance the dataset. After preparing the data by splitting it into training and test sets, a logistic regression model is trained and evaluated. The results show accuracy metrics for both training and test datasets. To improve the model, consider implementing feature scaling, evaluating additional metrics such as Precision and ROC-AUC, tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, using cross-validation for better performance estimation, and exploring other techniques for handling class imbalance. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`) and place the `creditcard.csv` file in the same directory as the script. For running the code, save it in a Python file (e.g., `fraud_detection.py`) and execute it using Python. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
